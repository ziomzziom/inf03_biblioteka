<p>The body of the webpage contains various sections such as a banner, contact information, pricing table, and a calculator to calculate the cost of placing an advertisement. The calculator is implemented using JavaScript and uses user input to calculate the total cost. </p>
<p>So, if the image of a webpage has been made in Inkscape, it means that it was created using vector graphics, making it easy to resize and edit without sacrificing image quality. This is especially useful for web design, where images need to be optimized for various screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
<p> CSS code defines the appearance of the banner, content boxes, and footer by setting properties such as background color, font family, text color, width, height, and alignment. It also sets the styling for the table and the input submit button.</p>
